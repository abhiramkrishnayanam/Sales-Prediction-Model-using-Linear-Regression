# Sales-Prediction-Model-using-Linear-Regression

## Problem Statement
A sales prediction model for "Big Mart Sales" is created using Linear regression. 

### Steps followed 

1. Imported required libraries

2. Load dataset

3. Data exploration (Shows first few rows)

4. Summary statistics using describe function.

5. Check data types.

6. Handling missing values

7. Sales distribution using a histogram (for outlet sales)

8. Feature selection

9. One-hot encoding of categorical variables

10. Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)

11. Check for missing values

12. Train the model

13. Make predictions

14. Calculate and print evaluation metrics (such as mean_absolute_error,mean_squared_error,root_mean_squared_error)

15. Plotting actual vs predicted values

16. Get feature names and coefficients and  Creating a DataFrame for visualization.Print the importance.

17. Save the model to a file.

The linear regression model developed for sales prediction successfully identified key relationships between the features and the target variable, Item_Outlet_Sales. By leveraging variables such as Item_MRP, Outlet_Type, and Item_Visibility, the model provides a reliable estimate of sales for different products across various outlets. Although linear regression is a simple approach, it has proven to be effective in capturing overall trends in the dataset. However, further improvements could be made by experimenting with more advanced models or by addressing issues such as multicollinearity and non-linearity within the features.
